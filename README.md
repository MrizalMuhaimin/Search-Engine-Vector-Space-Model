# Search-Engine-Vector-Space-Model
This project is a project related to one of the IF2123 course materials at ITB, namely Vector Algebra. In Vector Algebra, there is a dot product application on Information Retrieval with the Vector Space Model. Then we created a search engine that operates on the basis of the Vector Space Model.
